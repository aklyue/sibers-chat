I tried not to overdo it with component purity, not moving all the logic into custom hooks, so as not to lose the context of the logic within the components.

Frontend stack: React, Redux (RTK), React Router, Socket IO, TypeScript, MaterialUI, Framer Motion.

Backend stack: ExpressJS, TypeScript, Socket IO.

The project launches in two steps in the console:

1. sibers/client: npm start
2. sibers/server: ts-node index.ts
